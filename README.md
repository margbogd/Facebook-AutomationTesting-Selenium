Automated Testing on Facebook page with Selenium

1) On BaseTest you need to add the valid path from your local pc for chromedriver.exe
2) On TC_UI_FB_LGN_01_001 test you need to remove the comments from lines 24 and 25 and on FBLoginPage you need 
   to add your valid credentials in lines 59 and 60 in order to pass the test.
3) On FbSignUp you have to add your valid info in order to create a new account, in lines 101-104 and on 
   TC_UI_FB_CRT_02_001 you have to remove the comments from line 33 if you want to create the new account. Here, I am 
   just testing that the inputs fills with the data that I give. 
4) The HomePage is under construction.
